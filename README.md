# parallel-SSSP
This is a repository for parallel Single-Source Shortest Path algorithms to be presented at NTASC 2020 in fulfillment of the term
project requirements as specified in the syllabus for CMPS 5433 - Topics: Parallel/Distributed Systems: GPU Programming.

## Overview
This project shows the speedup gained by parallelizing Dijkstra's Algorithm for the GPU using CUDA C++. 
Each version will be run on Turing, MWSU's cluster, as well as TACC's Maverick2 cluster using NVIDIA's GTX 1080 Ti and Tesla V100.
